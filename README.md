## User requirements

As a user I am able to

- view 3 comics on page load
- send the url string to another user or open on another page and see the same comics
- see a loading indicator when waiting for the comic book to load
- input the comic number that I want to see
- click prev/next button to jump backward or forward on the comic based on the number of comics I can see.
- see an end and not press on the next button if I have come to the end of the comic
- choose the number of comics that I want to see: 1, 3, 5

As a user, I will encounter an error when I

- input an invalid comic number
- paste an invalid url string
